# ICME Python Summer Workshop, 2023 edition
This class introduces Python. Python is an easy to learn, versatile and powerful programming language. It can be used in many situations, from simple terminal scripting to data center-scale training for large language models.

This class is designed for maximum interactivity. It will consist of slides and lectures, mini-group exercises, quizzes and homework between the two sessions.

## Class outcome
After this class, you will
- Know what Python is, how it fits in the programming language ecosystem
- What problems Python is well suited to solve
- Be able to write simple Python program
- Be familiar with Python’s documentation
- Be familiar with the basic scientific & data science Python modules and know which is most appropriate in each situation

## About the Instructor
![Leopold](/assets/img/leopold.jpg){:style="max-width:30%;"}

Leopold graduated from ICME at Stanford with a Ph.D. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering in 2021. During his Ph.D., Léopold worked with Prof. Darve on developing new approximate direct solvers for very large systems of equations. Since 2021, Leopold works as a Software Engineer at NVIDIA, where he primarily works on the cuFFT and cuFFTMp libraries. He focuses on developing fast distributed FFT algorithms for efficiently using thousands of GPUs simultaneously. He also worked on DL frameworks such as JAX.

## About the Workshop Assistant
![Tianyu](/assets/img/tianyu.jpg){:style="max-width:30%;"}
Tianyu is a Ph.D. student in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University working with Prof. Susan Athey and Prof. Daniel McFarland. After receiving his Bachelor's degree in economics and mathematics at University of Toronto, Tianyu received his master's degree in Management Science and Engineering (MS\&E) at Stanford. His research has focused on the application of machine learning methods on social sciences.

# Workshop Materials

## Audience
This class assumes no prior knowledge of Python. However, basic knowledge (e.g. variables, if/else, for loop) of another programming language is required.

For instance, a student that took a statistics class using R for homeworks is ready for this class. On the other hand, a student with no programming experience whatsoever will find this class very difficult.

## Requirements
To attend this class, you’ll need a laptop or a desktop computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) with Zoom and a recent web browser. No installation of Python will be required. More detailed instructions will be provided prior to the class.

## Schedule
TODO(instructor): Make sure the dates and times are accurate below for your
course. E.g. replace `?`'s with the hour (or time-of-day)
that your course starts. Adjust time schedules within each session.

This class will focus on the basic building blocks for Python in scientific computing and data science, Specifically, we will cover:

#### Session 1 (July 24, Monday, 1:00 P.M. - 4:00 P.M. PST)
- General Python
  - What is Python? When is it useful?
  - Variables
  - Conditionals, loops
  - Containers
  - Functions
  - How to read Python’s documentation

#### Session 2 (July 25, Tuesday, 1:00 P.M. - 4:00 P.M. PST)
- Numpy
  - What is Numpy and why do we need it?
  - Arrays
  - Reshaping, slicing, broadcasting
- Pandas
  - Dataframes
  - Pivots
- The Python plotting ecosystem
  - Topic 1 with example time-allocation.
  - Topic 2 with example time-allocation, etc.
  - 15 minute Q&A
